<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hey, welcome to my world! ðŸ‘‹

Now I work for StarMaker, and have previously worked for Baiduï¼ˆç™¾åº¦ï¼‰and Kuaishouï¼ˆå¿«æ‰‹ï¼‰.

I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical Universityï¼ˆè¥¿åŒ—å·¥ä¸šå¤§å­¦ï¼‰in 2015 and 2018, respectively. And during my Master's degree, my main research focus was on acoustic echo cancellation.

My work and research interests cover meeting and entertainment scenarios, and mainly include: speech enhancement, audio effect, sound event detection, singing evaluation, speech quality assessment, speech synthesis, audio codec and so on.

I am skilled at using techniques based on traditional signal processing and deep neural networks to address these audio problems.

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, drawing anime characters and going on hikes.
