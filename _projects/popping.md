### Introduction
Mic popping refers to the unwanted explosive sound caused by bursts of air hitting the microphone diaphragm. This typically happens when pronouncing plosive sounds like "p," "b," or "t" directly into a microphone, especially when no pop filter is used.

There are some audio samples of mic popping suppression.
